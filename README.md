## About the book

If you’re an existing Java developer who wants to go full stack or pick up another frontend framework, this book is your concise introduction to React. In this three-part build-along, you’ll create a robust Spring Boot backend, a React frontend, and then deploy them together.
This new edition is updated to Spring Boot 3 and includes expanded content on security and testing. For the first time ever, it also covers React development with the in-demand TypeScript.
You’ll explore the elements that go into creating a REST API and testing, securing, and deploying your applications. You’ll learn about custom Hooks, third-party components, and MUI.
By the end of this book, you'll be able to build a full stack application using the latest tools and modern best practices.


## Key Takeaways
* Make fast and RESTful web services powered by Spring Data REST
* Create and manage databases using ORM, JPA, Hibernate, and more
* Explore the use of unit tests and JWTs with Spring Security
* Employ React Hooks, props, states, and more to create your frontend
* Harness the Material UI component library to customize your frontend
* Use the fetch API, Axios, and React Query for networking
* Add CRUD functionality to your apps
* Deploy your apps using AWS and Docker


## What's New 
This fourth edition has been updated to Spring Boot 3. Here are the biggest changes: 
* A new chapter introducing TypeScript, and TypeScript code throughout the book 
* More modern tooling (Maven -> Gradle, create-react-app -> Vite) 
* Expanded content on Spring Security and testing with Vitest 
* New content on fetching data with the React Query library

## Errata
## Page 304 - Using environment variables
### CarList Component Update
In the CarList.tsx file, update the conditional rendering logic to handle loading and error states properly.

Replace:
```javascript
const { data, error, isSuccess } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["cars"],
    queryFn: getCars
});

if (!isSuccess) {
    return Loading...
}
else if (error) {
    return Error when fetching cars...
}
else {
    ...
}
```
 With:
 ```javascript
const { data, isSuccess, isError, isLoading } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["cars"],
    queryFn: getCars
});

if (isLoading) {
    return Loading...
}
else if (isError) {
    return Error when fetching cars...
}
else if (isSuccess) {
    ...
}

```
